Idea 3 4 5 12 are good to go for now... Your current application is already quite feature-rich! However, here are a few more features you could consider adding to enhance functionality or usability:

3. File Sorting/Filtering
Add options to sort and filter the files displayed in the tree, like sorting alphabetically, by size, or by modification date. You could also allow users to filter by file type (e.g., only .txt files, .js files, etc.).

How to Implement:

Provide dropdowns or checkboxes in the sidebar for sorting and filtering files.

Modify the file tree rendering logic to display the files based on the chosen criteria.

4. Multiple File Selection
Allow users to select and perform actions on multiple files at once (e.g., delete, move, or copy multiple files). Currently, it seems like only one file is being selected at a time.

How to Implement:

Add checkboxes next to files for selection.

Implement functionality to bulk select files (via shift-click or select all button) and perform actions like delete or copy.

5. Directory Navigation Breadcrumb
As users interact with the directory, you could provide a breadcrumb trail that shows the current directory path and allows them to quickly jump to any parent directory.

How to Implement:

Dynamically generate a breadcrumb trail above the file tree, updating it whenever the user navigates to a new folder or file.

Allow the user to click any breadcrumb item to navigate to that directory.


12. Dark Mode Customization
Allow users to customize the dark mode theme by providing options for them to pick from different themes (light, dark, custom colors, etc.).

How to Implement:

Add a theme customization panel where users can change background colors, text colors, and other visual elements.

Store these preferences in local storage or a user profile.
